Focus Group 1:
- README work

Focus Group 2:
Take_Turn needs to be reworked
  - Allow attack input of (x,y)
  - Incorporate displaying player-specific boards/maps inside take turn

Focus Group 3:
- Force ships to print next to each other (make code recognize ship as new class)
- Start_Game needs its own file and init process
